# Override
## walk-through
- The binary file 'level06' executes any file with the name 'level06.php'.

- Creating a new file with that name and overriding the program by changing its content to something like `<?php echo exec('getflag');?>`.

- Running the executable with the 'malicious level06.php' file to get the flag.
